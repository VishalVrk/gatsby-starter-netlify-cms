# **Description**  

I come from the family of a national hero from South India. My grandpa PKS Kattuwa Mohaiyadeen, an Indian Freedom Fighter, was famous for his social activities and community services. My grandfather actively participated, and was committed and involved in the development of facilities such as education and health. He was therefore invited to actively participate in the regional political forums. He was also closely associated with Hon.K.Kamaraj former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and Hon. P Kakkan former Home Minister of the state of Tamil Nadu.

Inspired by my grandfather, I have been from my young age, involved in organizing blood donation camps, bringing peace and harmony to my fellow citizens. My early academic days were filled with keen involvement in the development and promotion of the ancient classical Indian language, Tamil.

This has been a major driving factor which lead me to becoming an internationally recognized Peace Activist and British Entrepreneur, The Founding Chairman and Board of Director for UK Charity “World Humanitarian Drive” and “Platinum Consultant London” for Trading and Developments. I take pride in being able to work towards finding sustainable solutions for current humanitarian crisis involving Racism, Terrorism, Radicalization, Human and Women’s Rights and Violence and Mass migration of people as refugees and supporting trade initiatives.
